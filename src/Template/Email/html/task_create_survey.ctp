<p>
    <?= $communityName ?> has been promoted to Step <?= $toStep ?> of CRI. The next step in the CRI
    process for that community is for ICI to
    <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">create a community <?= $newSurveyType ?> questionnaire in SurveyMonkey</a>
    for <?= $communityName ?>.
</p>

<p>
    Once this is done, <a href="<?= $actionUrl ?>">link the community's CRI account to the new questionnaire</a>.
